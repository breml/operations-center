# Cluster

Clusters represent a group of Incus servers running on top of IncusOS, that
allow to spread workloads across multiple servers.

Operations Center allows to provision clusters from registered [servers](server.md).

Provisioning of a cluster can be done through two slightly different approaches:

* [One off clustering](#one-off-clustering)
* [Template based clustering](#template-based-clustering)

In both cases, the administrator needs to provide the
[service configuration](#service-configuration) and the
[application configuration](#application-configuration).

Once one or many servers are clustered, Operations Center will automatically
keep track of their [inventory](inventory.md).

## Service Configuration

IncusOS system services are optional system-wide features, typically used to
integrate with an external system like storage or networking. The complete
list of services can be found in the
[IncusOS services documentation](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus-os/docs/main/reference/services/).

During clustering, service configuration is applied on each server.
The clustering process accepts a single configuration file (YAML or JSON)
containing the configuration for all services, where each
[service name](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus-os/docs/main/reference/api/#/services/services_get)
is a top-level key with the respective configuration underneath it.

Example with LVM and nvme service:

```yaml
---
lvm:
  enabled: true
  # System ID is automatically determined by Operations Center during clustering.
  # system_id: 0
nvme:
  enabled: true
  targets:
    - transport: tcp
      address: 192.168.1.100
      port: 8009
```

### Copying the Service Configuration when Adding Servers

When servers are added to an existing cluster, the service configuration of the
added servers is required to be consistent with the one of the existing cluster
members.

Instead of configuring the services on the new servers manually, the service
configuration can be copied from an existing cluster member by adding the
`--copy-services-config` flag:

```bash
operations-center cluster add-servers my-cluster --server-names new-server --copy-services-config
```

The configuration of the `lvm`, `iscsi`, `multipath`, `nvme`, `ceph`, `linstor`
and `ovn` services is copied. The LVM `system_id` is never copied. If the LVM
service needs to be enabled on an added server, the value is determined by
Operations Center for each added server individually, otherwise the `system_id`
of the added server is kept as is.

The `listen_address` of the `linstor` service and the `tunnel_address` of the
`ovn` service are member dependent, if they are set to a concrete IP address.
For those, the address of the added server is used, which is taken from the
network interface with the same role and of the same IP family as the address of
the cluster member the configuration is copied from. Empty and wildcard
addresses (e.g. `[::]:3366`) are copied as they are.

The configuration is copied before the servers join the cluster. If one of the
steps up to the join fails, Operations Center tries to restore the previous
service configuration of the added servers. Failures during the restore are
logged.

## Application Configuration

The application configuration provided during clustering follows the same format
as the preseed configuration used by Incus for
[non-interactive configuration](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/howto/initialize/#initialize-preseed)
(see [InitLocalPreseed](https://github.com/lxc/incus/blob/main/shared/api/init.go)
struct definition for full details).

Example:

```yaml
---
config:
  user.ui.title: "My wonderful cluster"
certificates:
  - type: client
    name: my-client-cert
    description: "Client certificate for accessing the cluster"
    certificate: |
      -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
      ...
      -----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

If `certificates` is empty, Operations Center adds the certificates from the
`trusted_tls_client_certificates` [security setting](settings.md#security-settings)
to the cluster, so whoever has access to Operations Center also has access to
the cluster. Providing at least one certificate disables this.

Certificates, which the cluster does already trust, e.g. because they have been
applied with the seed config of the servers, are not added a second time. They
are imported into the state of the generated Terraform configuration instead, so
they are managed the same way as the ones added by it.

## One Off Clustering

One off clustering takes a service configuration file, an application
configuration file and the list of to be clustered servers as arguments.

## Template Based Clustering

Template based clustering uses a [cluster-template](cluster-template.md),
a file containing key-value pairs for the defined variables in the
cluster-template and the list of to be clustered servers as arguments.

The file containing the variables has the following format (YAML):

```yaml
---
SOME_VARIABLE: "the value"
A_BOOLEAN_VARIABLE: true
A_NUMERIC_VARIABLE: 42
```

## Cluster Bulk Operations

Operations Center allows to perform bulk operations on clusters, which are then
applied to all members of the cluster. Operations Center supports the following
bulk operations:

* Adding or removing a vlan tags from network interfaces
* Adding or removing a storage target for iSCSI/NVME/multipath services
* Deploying of secondary application
* Updating of system settings:
   * Kernel
   * Logging

In order to execute a bulk operation, the action and its arguments need to be
provided.
